<h2 id="my-gophercon-experience">My GopherCon experience</h2>

<p>A couple of weeks ago I gave a talk at the largest Go conference, GopherCon, in Denver. It was the first time I attended GopherCon at all, and the first time ever I spoke in English in front of 1400+ people, and it was absolutely incredible experience. Here is my story.</p>

<p>My journey to GopherCon started in a cold winter day in the apartments in the centre of Odessa, Ukraine, where I was living at that time. By that time I was one of the organizators of the first Go meetup in Lviv (Ukraine), and  prepared one general talk about Go . We targeted mainly newcomers, so I wanted to make another talk that would share my passion and admiration of some of the coolest aspects of Go - concurrency.</p>

<p>I started to think how to show the beauty and easiness of writing concurrent programs in Go. There are numerous blog posts and talks on this subject, but I wanted something more appealing for the absolute beginners. With my love for good visualizations, my thoughts slipped into ways to visualize concurrency in some fancy way. At the last dotGo conference in Paris I was stunned by Matt Aimonetti&rsquo;s talk where he used hardware with LEDs to demonstrate program flow. It was really great and inspiring talk, so I decided to take this idea further and use a lot of LEDs to show goroutines and channels with colors and lights. That&rsquo;s gonna be cool!</p>

<p>But pretty soon I realized that I simply don&rsquo;t see a way how to show it in a clear and beautiful way. Colorful lights is a cool idea, but it should convey and demonstrate concurrency concepts in a first place. That led me to rethink how I see concurrency flows internally and it was pretty much clear that I see it in 3D. After quick googling about &ldquo;3D LEDs chains&rdquo; I understood that at this moment my goal was not feasible with this approach.</p>

<p>Okay, let&rsquo;s try another way. I&rsquo;ll draw it myself with nice visualization tools we have nowadays! There are a bunch of super nice JS frameworks for visualizing complex things, so in one or two evenings I should get what I want. But this attempt failed as well - all those frameworks are well-suited for representing 2D data, or for very specific 3D charts, but not for the custom 3D visualizations. Everything was suggesting to take a closer look at WebGL, and the only feasible option was to implement my idea using it by myself.</p>

<p>Next weekend I spend writing some JS code and learning Three.js framework, which was surprisingly cool. I must admit that writing JS code is a pain for me and I had to go the SPA every evening to get rid of a stress and muscular spasms. In a week or so, I had very simple demo of ping-pong code example, taken from Sameer Ajmani talk. It was very simple, with steps and timings done manually, but I was really excited.</p>

<p>Next challenge was to automate gathering steps and timings automatically from any Go program. My first attempt was to modify AST of the source and insert Println statements saying something like &ldquo;goroutine started&rdquo;, &ldquo;send to channel value X&rdquo; and so on. After practicing some kung-fu with go/[ast,parser,types} packages, I came with solution, but it was inherently flawed. It worked for very simple examples, where channels had the same name. For more complex examples I had to rename it manually, expand recursions and so on.</p>

<p>Anyway, it was enough to create slides for the talk for the meetup. I gave a talk, but it was quite bad, as I almost didn&rsquo;t prepare and was mostly busy with organization and preparing the first talk. So in a few days, on my way home, in a train I wrote an article &ldquo;Visualizing Concurrency in Go&rdquo; and published it next day.</p>

<p>Article was very well received. I was surprised by the number of responses, likes and stars. I got a few job proposals, letters asking permission to republish it or translate into other language. One of the letters was from Anthony Starks (?), the author of SVGo, who asked if I&rsquo;m considering to propose this idea as a talk for GopherCon. I didn&rsquo;t even considered myself as a speaker at the conference of that level, but next day I actually sent the proposal without any expectations.</p>

<p>In a few weeks I got an email that my proposal has been accepted. I&rsquo;m gonna be speaking at GopherCon! Wow!</p>

<p>I felt thrilled, pleased and scared at the same time. First of all, I&rsquo;ve never given a talk in English before. In fact, I didn&rsquo;t even speak English on a daily basis those days. Second, I had to rewrite my initial approach in order to open source it and present at the conference. Third, I was facing uncertainty of how scary this experience will be for me - giving a talk at the local meetup and at the conference with 1500+ people it&rsquo;s not the same.</p>

<p>The good thing is that I had time to prepare. More than 4 months of preparations! I even created an countdown on my watch, so I could track time left and prepare more efficiently. Around that time I read a post in my favourite blog &ldquo;Wait But Why?&rdquo; about author&rsquo;s experience of preparation to his TED talk. It was funny post, with some very important observations. One of the favourite topic of the author, Tim Urban, is a procrastination (actual topic of his talk, by the way) and he wrote how he spent most of the time procrastinating instead of preparing to the conference.</p>

<p>Of course, I&rsquo;m not like this. I have full 4 months ahead of me and I will use very day to do my best and prepare as best as I can!</p>

<p>Three months later I realized that I really have to stop procrastining and start doing something.</p>

<p>Okay, I had a good excuse. Around that time I changed my job and moved to Barcelona to work at Typeform. Exciting experience, great team and company, but also a lot of time stolen from my preparation plans and coding. My new approach for tracing concurrency events was based on Dmitry Vyukov&rsquo;s execution tracer and I actually did some initial coding. I also started speaking English on a daily basis which gave me some more confidence.</p>

<p>I also read a great book, &ldquo;Official TED guide for public speaking&rdquo; by Chris Anderson, the head of TED. It was a delightful reading and I highly recommend this book for anyone who interested in public speaking, TED conferences or both. It contains very deep insights of what really matters in public speaking. One of the main takeaways I got from this book is just to be yourself. I knew I&rsquo;m gonna be speaking on the same stage with awesome speakers as Kelsee Hightower, Rob Pike and Dave Cheney, and I was not even close to them as a speaker. But I have an idea. An idea that people wanted to hear about. And idea that is somehow unique and interesting - that&rsquo;s why my proposal was selected among others after all. I don&rsquo;t have to try to be such awesome speaker as Kelsey. instead I have to do it my way. With my bad accent, my first timer&rsquo;s nervousness and all this stuff. Just be yourself.</p>

<p>I was slowly moving forward, wrote some initial script for the talk, was improving code step by step, and my first kind of rehearsal was scheduled for the end of June to speak at Golang BCN meetup. This meetup had place in our office, and it went pretty well. I wasn&rsquo;t nervous at all, but I felt like I had no a connection with people. I was extremely concentrated on my text, reciting it from memory and it felt like almost the same if I would have spoken with the wall. I didn&rsquo;t like it. Audience should feel this immediately. Anyway, that rehearsal gave me another boost of confidence.</p>

<p>Few days before the flight. I&rsquo;m practicing talk every day, but here are two problems - lack of private space where I can practice loudly enough and failed attempt to use Leap Motion controller to handle visualization with hands. Well, it&rsquo;s not completely failed - I added code that allows me to use this awesome sensor in my presentation long time ago, but I was extremely unsatisfied with the result. My hope was that it&rsquo;s just a question of practice, but then I realized that approach I used to rotate and zoom visualization is too error prone - any accidental hand movement would mess the scene. I solved first problem by going to the sea in the late evening, and practicing talk speaking to the sea - luckily, I live right near the beach and I have a luxury opportunity of having sunbath and swimming in the sea before work every day. Regarding the Leap Motion issue, I decided to drop this idea and use fallback plan - usual trackpad, which is also fine. Time to pack bags.</p>

<p>At this point I want to make a pause and express my gratitude to the GopherCon org team. They did awesome job to organize and plan my trip to Denver at the highest level. I was proposed to have a mentor for my talk, and I happily agreed to have one, but in the end I decided to go through by myself. The trip itself and accomodation was simply amazing - long transatlantic flight went like a breeze (I watched UEFA Euro Final live in the plane!), and the hotel, which was just in front of Colorado Convention Center, was excellent. Special kudos for the key room design. Still keep it in my wallet.</p>

<p>Finally I&rsquo;m in Denver. My flight arrived in the afternoon and it was a day of rehearsal, so I rushed directly to the Convention Center, found a right hall, met Dave, Brian, Eric and others. Rehearsal went not so good as I expected - I forgot some simple words, Leap Motion controller messed the scene, but I got the idea of how room looks like, so it was worth it anyway. So now time to go to the hotel, practice talk a few more times in a hotel room and sleep well after long flight and make sure that jet-lag didn&rsquo;t spoil plans - I have a talk on the first day in the morning session!</p>

<p>Jet lag is much easier when flying from east to west, but it still breaks sleeping pattern. I woke up at 2:30 with a cold sweat - I had a dream that I overslept my talk. In a dream, brain doesn&rsquo;t really know if it was for real or it was a dream, so the emotions was pretty real. Imagine my relief when I realised it was just a dream! Again, practicing talk in the morning, breakfast, another practice in the room, time to go!</p>

<p>An hour before the talk. I should have been nervous, but I haven&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s my first public speaking experience, but I&rsquo;m pretty excited to show my project to such an amazing community. It&rsquo;s probably was the most important thing for me - atmosphere and people were super welcoming, and it killed much of nervousness at its roots. Like why should I be nervous if those people are so welcoming and I feel like even if I&rsquo;m failed they will support me and cheer in any case! It was priceless. The only strong feeling I remember is inability to relax, to start enjoying other talks and conversations - maximum concentration for the next hour!</p>

<p>Finally, my turn! Kelsey is doing great introduction, technicians are helping with microphone, I&rsquo;m placing my laptop onto the lectern, connecting Leap Motion (I decided to take a risk in the last moment!) and here we go! Not to mention my accent, I felt like my concentration paid off and I really enjoyed to finally tell everything I wanted to. I memorized talk pretty well, so I could improvize a little bit, pay more attention to pauses and even try to make an eye contact with some people between the sentences. The bright lights of projectors made it difficult, but anyway, I felt great and when people burst into the laugh on a first joke, I felt even more confident. At the moment I&rsquo;m writing this, there is not video published, so I&rsquo;m enjoying by thought that it went well :) Anyhow, I really had fun doing this talk.</p>

<p>The moment I left the stage was incredible. I was still excited, but there were nothing to worry anymore and I could finally relax and start fully enjoying the conference and other talks.
In the next hours I was approached by so many people and got so many kind words and responses.  It was pleasant when people came to you just to say that your talk was great, but the most precious part of it is that the conversations were started naturally and I got chance to meet  to so many awesome talented people, I wouldn&rsquo;t met otherwise.</p>

<p>That was my only big upset of the conference - there are so many great people, and it&rsquo;s simply impossible to have conversation with all of them. I mean, it&rsquo;s technically impossible. If I spend only 10 minutes per conversation, in order to cover all gophers I need 10 min x 1400 = 14K min = 233 hours = 9.72 days of non-stop conversations! And people are the most important part of any conference and any community. At GopherCon you can randomly meet people in a deli line and one guy would be from IBM Watson, another girl would be from Docker or Intel and you can end up sitting at the same table with vim-go creator or even with Go authors itself! It&rsquo;s amazing.</p>

<p>The level of the conference organization and talks was also extremely high. One of the outstanding things was live captioning in real time. I&rsquo;ve never seen that before and it looked like magic. :) There was a real person sitting in a special room, listening for what speakers talking and she was transcripting it in real time using special software! The room was big and spacious, there was enough space for everyone and three gigantic screens made the experience comfortable even for the back rows of this huge hall.</p>

<p>I really enjoyed many talks, the range of topics was quite broad - from the hardcore internals of Go runtime implementation to the community growth discussions and a character study of Go gopher :) Organizers did a great job on selecting proposals and I felt really honoured to be on stage with THAT people.</p>

<p>Another special moment for me was a speaker&rsquo;s dinner. I happened to be sitting at the same table as Rob Pike, Renee French and Andrew Gerrand. Well, I&rsquo;m not fan or anything, but having dinner with such people is something I couldn&rsquo;t even imagine. The place was pretty loud, and it was difficult to have comfortable conversation, but anyway we talked not only about Go, but also about casual things, about Barcelona, figure skating, alcohol drinking culture, movies etc. And from my side, I really did enjoy the conversation, especially some answers and stories told. It wasn&rsquo;t typical chit-chatting, for sure. So yeah, that dinner was quite special for me. Renee French drew (less than in a minute!) and presented to me that great gopher doing figure skating! How talented she is!</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s been more than three weeks already, but it still seems like GopherCon was just yesterday. It affected my view and understanding of Go community - it&rsquo;s got REAL now. I mean, it&rsquo;s not the first Go conference I&rsquo;ve been to, but it wasn&rsquo;t just a Go conference, it was place where Go community becomes real. Twitter nicknames convert to the real people, Slack conversations transforms into the face to face talks with a good food or coffee, and the distance between Go users and Go creators literally disappears. It&rsquo;s now impossible to stay aside from the community concerns, problems and projects. Is it normal to go to the tech conference and meet so many incredibly inspiring people?</p>

<p>Thank you everyone for the chance to meet you. And special thanks to the GopherCon organizers to make this event happen!</p>
